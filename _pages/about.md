This is the personal website of Dr Lee Devlin at the University of Liverpool. 

Research interests
======
My primary area of research is in Bayesian signal processing with a focus on Sequential Monte Carlo methods for static and time evolving problems. I am interested how these class of algorithms can be applied to HPC archetectures and be used to solve difficult problems.
