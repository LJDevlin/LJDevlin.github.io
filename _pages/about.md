This is the personal website of Dr Lee Devlin at the University of Liverpool. 

Research interests
======
<p align="justify"> My primary area of research is in Bayesian signal processing with a focus on Sequential Monte Carlo methods for static and time evolving problems. I am interested how these class of algorithms can be applied to distributed computing architectures. </p>

**Current PhD students**
* Harvinder Lehal - '_Developing Efficient Numerical Algorithms Using Fast Bayesian Random Forests_',  with Professor Simon Maskell, 2022- Present
* Daniel Sumler - '_Bayesian Learning for Sparse High-Dimensional Data_', with Professor Simon Maskell, 2023 - Present 
* Sion Lynch - '_Machine learning to track multiple objects using raw radar data in the maritime environment_', with Dr Angel Garcia-Fernandez, 2024- Present

Teaching
======
I currently teach on the following modules:
* [ELEC319 - Image Processing](https://tulip.liv.ac.uk/mods/student/ELEC319_202526.htm) - Module co-ordinator - 2025-Present
* [ELEC320 - Neural Networks](https://tulip.liv.ac.uk/mods/student/ELEC320_202526.htm) - Module co-ordinator - 2022-Present
* [ELEC230 - Robotic Systems](https://tulip.liv.ac.uk/mods/student/ELEC230_202526.htm) - co Module co-ordinator- 2022-Present
* ELEC340/440 - Final Year projects - I typically supervise 5-7 projects each year

Affiliations and commitments
======
I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (HEA).

I have reviewed articles for IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, The Journal of Instrumentation (JINST), Machine Learning: Science and Technology (IOP), Digital Signal Processing (Elsevier), and Biometrical Journal.
