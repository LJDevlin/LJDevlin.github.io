This is the personal website of Dr Lee Devlin at the University of Liverpool. 

Research interests
======
<p align="justify"> My primary area of research is in Bayesian signal processing with a focus on Sequential Monte Carlo methods for static and time evolving problems. I am interested how these class of algorithms can be applied to distributed computing architectures. </p>

**Current PhD students**
* Harvinder Lehal - '_Developing Efficient Numerical Algorithms Using Fast Bayesian Random Forests_',  2022- Present
* Daniel Sumler - '_Bayesian Learning for Sparse High-Dimensional Data_', 2023 - Present 

Teaching
======
I currently teach on the following modules:
* [ELEC320 - Neural Networks](https://tulip.liv.ac.uk/mods/student/ELEC320_202425.htm) - Module co-ordinator - 2022-Present
* [ELEC230 - Robotic Systems]((https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/info/portal/pls/portal/tulwwwmerge.mergepage?p_template=m_ee&p_tulipproc=moddets&p_params=%3Fp_module_id%3D200215)) - co Module co-ordinator- 2022-Present
* ELEC340/440 - Final Year projects - I typically supervise 5-7 projects each year

Affiliations and commitments
======
I am an associate fellow of the Higher Education Academy (HEA).

I have reviewed articles for IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, and The Journal of Instrumentation (JINST).
